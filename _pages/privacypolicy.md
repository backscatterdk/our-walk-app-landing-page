# Backscatter Aps - Our Walk App Privacy Policy

The Our Walk App (henceforth referred to as the ‘Service’) is a web-based service by Backscatter Aps (henceforth referred to as ‘Our Company’).

At Our Company data protection and confidentiality is a high priority. This privacy policy will explain how Our Company processes the personal data we collect from you when you use our Service.

This Privacy Policy is set out to comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR).


## Data controller and contact information

The Service is offered by:

 

Backscatter Aps

Company reg. no. 38486489

Oceanvej 1

2150 København

E-mail: [info@backscatter.dk](mailto:info@backscatter.dk)

Telephone: +45 53 54 61 60


## What data do we process, why and how?

We collect your data and process data when you:



* Register with Our Company as a user of the Service

    The processing of your data when registering as a user is necessary for using the Service, cf. GDPR art. 6(1)b).

* Use the Service to conduct a photo walk

    The processing of your data when conducting a photo walk is voluntary and based on your consent to the permissions dialogue popping up in relation to the use of your mobile camera and the location tracking on your phone.

* Use the Service to react to other people's images

    The processing of your data when reacting is voluntary.



## Information you provide to us

The Service stores your username and e-mail address when you register to conduct a photo walk.


### Information we collect automatically when you use the Services


a) The images you take as well as their latitude and longitude (if you allow location permissions)

b) The annotations you make to your own and other’s pictures

c) Your route when you decide to do a photo walk

We have deliberately designed the location tracking in such a way that you are asked for permission to track you and the Service only tracks you when you are in ‘walking mode’. It is only when you select the option to ‘go for a walk’ that location tracking is turned on. Every time you go on a walk you are notified that this is the case.


### How will we use your data?

Our Company processes your data so that we can:



* Register you as a user of the Service
* Provide our Services
* Run, maintain and develop the Service
* Conduct analyses of your relation to the city

Our Company does not transfer your personal data to a third party without asking for your consent, in a way that is clearly distinguishable from the basic uses of the app. Under specific circumstances and with reference to legislation, it might be necessary to transfer information to public authorities.


### How do we store your data?

The Service securely stores your data in data centers within the EU, which is compliant to GDPR. Your personal data will not be transferred to third countries outside the EU or the EEA. Your data is only accessible with a functioning API key provided by Our Company.


### When will we delete your data?

Our Company will delete or anonymize your personal data when you de-register as a user of the Service. This will take place as soon as possible and no later than 6 months after de-registration.
